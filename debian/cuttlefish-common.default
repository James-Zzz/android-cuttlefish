# Network bridge to use with the cuttlefish wifi tap devices. By default,
# we will create and destroy a managed bridge called 'cvd-wbr' but all
# interfaces comprising this bridge will be NAT'ed, and IPv6 will not
# be configured. Setting a preconfigured bridge interface here (usually
# with just one physical ethernet controller in it) suppresses bridge
# management, and instead adds the cuttlefish wifi tap devices the
# specified bridge. By specifying a network interface here, you can
# disable IPv4 or IPv6 bridging with 'ipv4_bridge' and 'ipv6_bridge'.
